# Big O

### Time Complexity

Time complexity measures the time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size (n).

It is represented using Big O notation, which describes the **worst case scenario**.

Common time complexities include:

- O(1) - Constant Time
- O(n) - Linear Time
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time
- O(n2) - Quadratic Time

It helps assess an algorithm's efficiency in scaling with larger inputs.

### Space Complexity

Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size.

It accounts for both auxilary space (temporary variables) and input space. Like time complexity, it is expressed in Big O notation, such as:

- O(1) - Constant Space
- O(n) - Linear Space
